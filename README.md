The DAO Visualization and Simulation Builder

Intro:
DAOs currently lack any coherent visual identity or experiential onboarding. This project will research, develop, and prototype an open-source framework for creating 2D and 3D visualizations and simulations to enable experiential onboarding to DAOs.

Current Team: 
Lawrence Lek and Tony Lai

Rationale:
Over the last ten years Lawrence has been using video game engines to build open world simulations and digital installations, primarily for audiences across the fields of visual art, gaming, and electronic music. My interest in utopian architecture has led me to try to create futuristic or fantastical versions of real-life environments. Core to these experiences has been the idea of bringing a utopian world view to virtual worlds, giving players a chance to access places that are often private or closed to ordinary people. At the same time, Lawrence has been very invested in using his background in electronic music to collaborate with other musicians to build immersive audiovisual experiences of these places

Lawrence has rendered a futuristic vision of Singapore after environmental catastrophe (the game ‘2065’), created a hybrid digital/physical club space in London (‘Temple’), created a simulation of an automated luxury hotel (‘Nøtel’), rendered multiple physical art spaces as utopian open-world games (‘Bonus Levels’) and created a floating tube line that connects disconnected areas across London (‘Sky Line’).

Now, we would like to bring this background to develop a framework to give a coherent visual and architectural identity to the emerging metaverse of DAOs. Since Lawrence's expertise as a virtual architect lies in giving spatial identity to social communities, we would love to develop a prototype that goes beyond the sphere of visual arts. We are particularly interested in the potential of blockchain to create new communities that are fundamentally different in terms of access and ownership and this is very important in terms of creative art-making.

We would like to support the development of an ecosystem around bringing in-game world-building and artistic communities to blockchain communities, and to develop a new kind of game that is both proof of concept of blockchain protocol capabilities, and proof that an artwork can be a community-facilitation mechanism. 

Open Source elements:

We envisage that the code to enable the bridging from in-game worlds to various blockchain protocol dapps and modules will be open-source, as well as the documentation around this bridging. In addition, the components of the project that are developed with blockchain ecosystems will also be open-source. 

The game design, including visual assets - buildings in the DAOTown, ,aps, graphics, pixel art, 3D models; sound assets; narrative design and user experience, along with the game engines (e.g. Unity) to implement these designs will not be open-source.
